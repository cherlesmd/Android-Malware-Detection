The SVC and RandForest model from sckit-learn proved to be the most accurate. This is only after pre-processing the dataset using pandas and numpy.

## Pre-Processing

I worked on the RandomForest model so I will be going over that process.

Dropped columns that had any missing data rows and any that were not comparable data values and others that subjectively seemed irrelevant.

Changed the IP into ints by splitting at decimals and adding missing missing 0's appropiately.

Changed label column into binary values 1 and 0, combining malware and scareware into 1 value as we want to catch either one despite their distinctions.

Ran columns 'Protocol', ' PSH Flag Count', ' ACK Flag Count' through OneHotEncoder using ColumnTransformer.

Use 50 components for PCA to transform training and testing data.

## RandomForest Model Results

Ran the RandomForest model with n_estimators = 190, max_depth=34, max_features='sqrt'

Got an accuracy score 0.9379 or 93.79%.

This accuracy is achieved greatly due to creating a binary target label which the decision trees the model is based on excels at.
